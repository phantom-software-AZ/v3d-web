If you have bug fixes and documentation fixes to v3d-web, send us your pull requests! For those just getting started, GitHub has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Once you create your pull request, we will review the bug/documentation fixes as soon as possible. Once verified, we will acknowledge your contribution in the pull request comments, manually merge the fixes into our codebase, and close the pull request.
